# awesome-energy-tools
The main goals of this repository are as follows:
1. Create a central hub of datasets and tools tailored for energy practitioners with intermediate programming skills. 
2. Facilitate energy research efforts and collaboration

The foundation of this repository is inspired by the excellent paper of Hussain Kazmi, Íngrid Munné-Collabo, Fahad Mehmood, Tahir Abbas Syed and Johan Driesen:

[Towards data-driven energy communities:
a review of open-source datasets, models and tool](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111290)
